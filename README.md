# The unscrubbed data set is tweets_gender.csv. The scrubbed dataset tweets_gender_new.csv removes all tuples without male or female in the gender. 
# The fields of interest are gender (label), and a field that is a combination of description (twitter bio) and text (tweet). I trained on this data
# using a simple one directional RNN. I hope to introduce new strategies such as multilayered and bidirectional RNNs as well.
